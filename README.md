This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Web React Boilerplate

In this project you will find a boilerplate ready to be used with Firbase.
This is the Stack:

- Typescript
- React
- React Router
- Chackra UI
- Storybook
- Firebase

Please run 
### `npm install`
once the project has been downloaded.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run storybook`
Runs storybook, so that you can test and document new/old components.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.
